# PRODIGY_CS_03
This repository contains the information for the task that I have completed for my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Task 2: Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

I have used VSCode and Python programming language to run the program.
